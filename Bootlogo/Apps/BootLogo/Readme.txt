  BootLogo by Schmurtz
=========================

How to install :
===================================================================
Copy Apps, Emus and System folders to the root of your SD card, then run the app "BootLogo".


How to use with your own images :
===================================================================
Copy your own .bmp image files in "Apps\BootLogo\Images".
Run the "BootLogo" application.
(Press select to hide the _BootLogo item in the emulator list)


Some rules to respect to create your own boot logo :
===================================================================
The logo must be in .bmp format
not exceeding 6 MB
Ideally a resolution of 1280px by 720px.  A larger dimension (width or length) is not possible.


Additional information :
===================================================================
Bootlogo app will check these parameters automatically : 
- If the resolution is 1280x720 (less is OK, more will stop the flash process)
- Check if the file is really a BMP (bitmap) file (to avoid renaming with bad extension)
- Check if the file size is inferior to 6MB
TrimUI default stock bootlogo is included.
