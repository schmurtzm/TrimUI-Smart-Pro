How to install :
===================================================================
Copy Apps and System folders to the root of your SD card, then run the app "EmuCleaner".



Additional information :
===================================================================
EmuCleaner will edit "Emus/show.json" to show or hide emulators, which means that it uses the same way as the native emulators selector system offered with stock OS, so you'lll be still able to hide/show emulators manually from stock MainUI after using EmuCleaner.
